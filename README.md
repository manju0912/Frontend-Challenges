# Frontend-Challenges

This repository contains the frontend project challenges from Codell.cc and FrontendMentor.io websites. These websites provide the real world professional UI design templates to solve.<br/>
I have used HTML/CSS and JavaScript technologies to solve these challenges.<br/>
<a href="https://www.codewell.cc/">Codewell</a> and <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/">Frontend Mentor</a> are the platforms where developers can improve their coding skills by practicing and building real world projects.
